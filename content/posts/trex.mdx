A **Tyrannosaurus**, fierce and grand,  
Stomped across the ancient land.  
But something seemed a little strangeâ€”  
His arms were **long**, a drastic change!  

No tiny claws, no stubby reach,  
He grabbed a coconut off the beach.  
With ease, he climbed a mighty tree,  
Confusing all who came to see.  

*"This isn't right!"* the raptors cried,  
*"A T-Rex shouldn't swing or glide!"*  
Yet there he hung, with goofy grace,  
A dino out of time and place.  

His legs, however, small and weak,  
Made his running skills quite bleak.  
He tripped, he tumbled, rolled in shame,  
A king unfit for hunting game.  

He waved his arms, he scratched his chin,  
*"I must adapt,"* he said with a grin.  
And so he learned to bake instead,  
With cookies shaped like dino heads.  

Now legends tell of the **T-Rex Chef**,  
Whose skills in baking were truly deft.  
And though his legs were much too short,  
His pastries won the raptors' hearts.

**Moral:** *Even a dinosaur can find a new calling.*
