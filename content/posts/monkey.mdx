A **three-legged monkey** danced by the bay,  
Under the moonlight, silver and gray.  
He hopped and he spun, a sight so rare,  
While whispers of legend floated in air.  

A woman watched from the old wooden pier,  
Clutching a **monkey-foot necklace** near.  
Her eyes held secrets, dark and deep,  
Of wishes granted, and prices steep.  

*"Step not closer,"* the monkey cried,  
*"That charm you wear once belonged to my pride."*  
*"A gift was taken, a wish was made,"*  
*"But fateâ€™s price never fully paid."*  

The wind grew still, the waves withdrew,  
The stars above took on a darker hue.  
She shuddered once and closed her eyes,  
For in her palm, the foot felt alive.  

With trembling breath, she tossed it wide,  
Into the sea, where echoes hide.  
The monkey bowed and leapt away,  
Leaving her fate to the tides that sway.

**Moral:** *Beware the gifts of fate, for they may demand more than you wish to pay.*
