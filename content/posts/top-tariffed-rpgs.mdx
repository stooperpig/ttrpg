The tabletop roleplaying game, TTRPG, community must prepare as politics takes a seat at the table cosplaying as <strong>tariffs</strong>.

<h3><strong>TTRPG: Top Tariffed Roleplaying Games</strong></h3>
The 145 percent tax on Chinese imports may change tomorrow, but today it impacts <strong>Dungeons and Dragons</strong> and crowdfunded games. 
<strong>Dungeons and Dragons</strong> holds a large segment of the <strong>TTRPG</strong> market and relies on physical products, like miniatures, books and accessories. 
Reflecting on the video game industryâ€™s response, price increases are expected.
Nintendo increased prices from the industry standard of $60 per game to $80 per game and reduced holiday promotions, according to Forbes. Cost of the Switch 2 also increased 50 percent more than the original price. 

<strong>Dungeons and Dragons</strong> is protected because it is established with a loyal customer-base unlike crowdfunded games. Crowdfunded games, like those on Kickstarter, must brace for damaging impact as they have a few options - none offering solace. 
Crowdfunded games can lose earned profits. Unless game designers previously calculated the tax increase in their production budgets, designers may pay the <strong>tariff</strong> costs out-of-pocket. This leads to the game designers lacking any profit gains for themselves, but may save the project. However, it will cut the life-cycle of the game short. The profit loss will cause the delay or even lack of follow-up in expansions and new supplements.  
Designers may not want to sacrifice hard-earned profits. 

Cost may then be pushed on the consumers including those who already invested. While it is a simple business call, consumers may feel the price increase at checkout. 
Select books, like those printed on thin paper such as bibles, and baby boardbooks, are currently exempt from the <strong>tariffs</strong>. All other print books manufactured will be affected because of the manufacturing cost increases in response to the <strong>tariffs</strong>. These costs would be on the consumer.

Some crowdfunded game designers may no longer wish to outsource publication production and choose to self publish. This is a solution to avoid the initial <strong>tariffs</strong> but not viable for cutting costs. Self publication is a daunting and time-consuming task that requires purchase of materials and tools, which are still tariffed. 
Raw materials and machine parts needed to maintain the printing equipment are tariffed. Additionally, 73 percent of paper is imported from Canada, according to NBC. 

The remaining option for designers of crowdfunded games is to cancel the project and issue refunds. This may result in disappointment for both the game designers and consumers alike. Players miss out on games they anticipated and purchased. Game designers are left discouraged and may not attempt new projects, leading to the eradication of potentially ground-breaking games. 

Best solution to avoid the <strong>tariffs</strong> is to keep all publications digital; do not publish physical books. The answer is not ideal, but it is effective when avoiding <strong>tariffs</strong> for now. Computers, phones and tablets are widely available for the majority, some accessible for free at your local library. 
The next best solution is tight-writing all print material. If it is necessary to print physical media, tight-writing can cut down page count to save money.

<h3><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h3> As <strong>tariffs</strong> hit the tables, it is imperative for the <strong>TTRPG</strong> community to combat the costs together. <strong>TTRPGs</strong> are cooperative games, and now is the time to use that cooperative spirit. It is not one player who takes down the big bad evil guy, BBEG; it is everyone.
