There once was a cow, **angry and mean**,  
Her mood was foul, her temper keen.  
She kicked and bellowed, fumed with spite,  
Never happy, always in a fight.  

Her name was **Ferrule**, the **Hateful Cow**,  
She made the barnyard tremble and bow.  
Every day, she'd stomp and glare,  
With a glare so cold, no one would dare.  

But one day, a **pig** came to her side,  
A hero of sorts, full of pride.  
He was **StooperPig**, the pig so bold,  
His cape a flag, his heart of gold.  

*"Ferrule,"* said StooperPig, with a grin so wide,  
*"Why all the hate? Come, let me guide!"*  
But Ferrule snorted, "I don’t need your help,  
I’ll take on the world, just you watch and yelp!"  

StooperPig, undeterred, stayed by her side,  
Using his powers to try and guide.  
With super strength and clever charm,  
He tried to calm her, without alarm.  

Together they fought, through fields and barns,  
Saving cows from scary storms,  
But Ferrule’s heart, so cold and tough,  
Was hard to melt, no matter how rough.  

One day, as they faced a great big fox,  
Ferrule froze, caught in her thoughts.  
It was StooperPig who leaped to the fray,  
And saved the barnyard, day by day.  

Now Ferrule, still angry, still full of fire,  
But slowly, she softened, just a little, by desire.  
She didn’t smile, but she didn’t fight,  
And StooperPig, her hero, was her guiding light.

**Moral:** *Even the angriest have a sidekick to help them fight.*
