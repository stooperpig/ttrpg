# **Stories Brought to Life**  

Hi, I’m Chuck. I’ve been a Dungeon Master for about a decade now, driven by a lifelong love for fantasy and storytelling. That passion started early—when I first learned to read at four years old—and was solidified in the fourth grade by my teacher, Mrs. Berkshire. She introduced me to fantasy beyond the screen through daily storytime, where she read *Rowan of Rin* to the class. I was captivated. Each line of dialogue, every description of scenery, and the thrilling encounters with strange creatures leapt off the page, transforming into vivid scenes in my mind. That was the moment I fell in love with storytelling.  

As I grew, my fascination with narrative deepened. I explored different styles of storytelling—scripts, plays, poetry, journalism, documentaries, even photography and cinematography. My love for the arts led me to the stage, where I found myself working on lights, staging, audio, and set design. By senior year, I was shaping nearly every production at my school. After graduation, I turned that passion into a profession, running sound and lighting for churches, weddings, charity events, and stage plays.  

I had always known about *Dungeons & Dragons*. My mom even tried to introduce me to it in high school, but at the time, I dismissed it as *Satan’s Game*. Years later, I became disillusioned with mainstream entertainment. TV shows felt formulaic, music uninspired, books required too much effort, and poetry had become either too abstract or too direct. I craved something different. I wanted a way to stay connected with my friends across distances, but video games were getting expensive. Then I discovered *Actual Play* shows and decided to give D&D a try.  

My first campaign was *brutal*. Our group attempted a rotating DM structure where each of us would take turns world-building by NPC-ifying our characters while the goddess of fate tossed us through different eras. It was a noble experiment, but ultimately, it didn’t work. Still, I was hooked. I found another group, one that was truly invested in the story. By then, I had studied DMing extensively and had honed my craft—I was *good* at it.  

That’s when I learned about professional Dungeon Masters. I had seen *Critical Role*, *Dimension 20*, and other high-profile Actual Plays, but I hadn’t realized that DMs were running games professionally without streaming them. People on the coasts were making thousands of dollars a month doing what I loved. I sought out a local company with the same vision and joined them. We even had a successful Kickstarter… until the company collapsed. That was nearly three years ago. But I walked away with something valuable—lessons from its failures.  

Which brings us to today.  

I founded **Malve Studios** to provide a platform for DMs to go professional and to set a standard for what that means. For years, the distinction between a hobby DM and a pro DM has been vague at best. Players deserve an experience that transcends the usual game night at the dining room table or the crowded LGS. An online game should be memorable—an adventure that stays with you long after the session ends. The stories we weave together should come alive, just like they did for me in Mrs. Berkshire’s classroom all those years ago. A **professional** Dungeon Master should be able to craft that magic for their players.  

That’s what Malve Studios is here to do.
