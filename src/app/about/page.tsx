            <br />About<br />
            At Malve Studios, we're all about giving tabletop gamers access to top-tier resources for their games. It all starts with the Master—whether it’s Dungeon, Game, or any other creative title they prefer. Every Master is vetted and tested before they join us, meeting our picky standards, because we know players have certain expectations, too. Once a Master proves they can deliver, we provide them with the tools to elevate the experience—everything from assets and virtual tools to physical tabletop essentials. That way, players leave our games with unforgettable stories to share.

We get it—not everyone wants to hit the bar or the club where it’s hard to hear your friends, and sporting events can sometimes feel isolating. Playing a Tabletop Roleplaying Game from the comfort of home (or a friend’s place) shouldn’t cost more than a night out, so we’ve made sure our pricing is comparable. And the best part? You’re in control of the snacks and drinks, because you’ve already got them on hand. If you and your friends are separated by distance, no problem—playing a TTRPG online with a Malve Master is easy and stress-free. All you need to do is log in, and we provide the tools and links to get the adventure started.

For those of you who prefer that classic in-person game with pencil and paper, but don’t want the hassle of running it—don’t worry, we’ve got you covered. Whether it’s prepping minis or terrain, we can help you find a Master nearby to bring the game to you. Just let us know, and we’ll do our best to match you with someone in your area for a great session. All you need to bring is yourself…and maybe some snacks for the table.

And if you’re reading this thinking, “Hey, I’d love to join them,” we’re always on the lookout for new GMs. Reach out and let us know you’re interested in becoming one of our bespoke Masters, and we’ll set up an audition. Not quite there yet, but want to improve your DM skills? We’ve got something for you, too. Let us know if you’d like to learn, and we’ll pair you with one of our Mentors for a chat—whether it’s over coffee or a remote call, we’ll help you level up your game.
