            <br />Pricing<br />
            At Malve Studios, we want to be super clear about our pricing for both drop-in games and long-term campaigns. Plus, we want you to know exactly how much your GM is earning from each session. For our Drop-In Campaigns, it&apos;s $40 per seat for a full 4-hour session. For long-term campaigns, it&apos;s $35 per seat for a 3-4 hour session, billed in 12-hour chunks.<br /><br />

<br />Each GM gets $35 per seat for Drop-In Campaigns and $30 per seat for long-term campaigns. The GM and the group can decide the schedule for long-term campaigns, and you&apos;re free to skip sessions when needed. But if an entire 12-hour block is cancelled without a heads-up, weCll look into whether the campaign should continue or wrap up. If skipping a block is agreed upon in advance, no worriesâ€”there won&apos;t be any investigation.<br /><br />
