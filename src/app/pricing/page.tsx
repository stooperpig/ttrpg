            <br />Pricing<br />
            We at Malve Studios want to make sure that we are crystal clear about pricing up front for both drop-in and long form campaigns. We also want to make sure you know exactly how much your Professional GM is making off of every session. Our pricing for our Drop-In Campaigns is $40/seat for the full 4 hour session. Our pricing for long form campaigns is $35/seat for a full 3-4 hour session and is billed in 12 hour blocks. Each Professional GM will make $35/seat for Drop-In Campaigns and $30/seat for long form campaigns for every session run. The GM and the party make their own schedule for long form campaigns. A GM or their party may skip sessions as wanted or necessary. However, should a full 12 hour block of sessions be cancelled consecutively without warning, there will be an investigation to determine if the campaign should close out without continuing or if a new block should be implemented. If the skipping of a block is agreed upon before the block is scheduled, there will be no investigation. For any concerns or questions, feel free to <a href="/contact-us">Contact Us.</a><br /><br />
